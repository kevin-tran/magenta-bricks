Magneta Bricks - Kevin Tran

To whom it may concern, this is my attempt at the coding challenge. For the sake of an mvp to present, I've used https://github.com/srinisoundar/react-webpack-babel-kit as the boilerplate. I know from the requirements that React components need to be made, some I'm making some technical assumptions before I get too deep into the project. This has been chosen for the following requirements:

- Optimization out of the box, webpack will completely minify a production ready build.
- Quality of life measures: allows the compiling of ES5 and sass painlessly. Using gulp to do this can be quite involved, as well as things like Hot Reloading are much easier to get without having to patch on more plugins.
